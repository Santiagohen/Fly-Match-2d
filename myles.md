Add any keys to the data structure for proper use of information.

Planning with the team, lots of different ideas.

None, really.

### Do you believe you are giving your best effort to the team?
Indubitably, I may have perhaps confused some of the others with a concept I had, but it should be fine.

### What is one way you hope to improve your site by the end of the week?
Hopefully it will have the basic functions needed.

### What is one technical challenge that is currently keeping you from moving forawrd in your project?
Like I said above I was trying to speak about an idea I had but it's a little confusing to speak about how it would be written in code.

### What is one way you can support your team better moving forward?
Communicating better, I suppose.


## 10/7/24
### What is one idea/topic that you have had to revisit from last year while building your project?
Using localstorage for logging in.

### What is one real world reference web site that you have used to inspire your work on this project? What is it about that site that appeals to you?
I didn't use any reference as I worked on the backend and there's really no way to see the backend of any running website.

### Have you considered how users with sight disabilities might view your site? Have you taken into account color blindness or poor vision? Do you need to re-examine or recalibrate your sites font sizes or colors?
I haven't paid too much attention to the design of our site, unfortunately. I was focused on researching login functionality, encrypting passwords, and trying to do the search function for flights.
