Planning with the team, lots of different ideas.

### Do you believe you are giving your best effort to the team?
Indubitably, I may have perhaps confused some of the others with a concept I had, but it should be fine.

### What is one way you hope to improve your site by the end of the week?
Hopefully it will have the basic functions needed.

### What is one technical challenge that is currently keeping you from moving forawrd in your project?
Like I said above I was trying to speak about an idea I had but it's a little confusing to speak about how it would be written in code.

### What is one way you can support your team better moving forward?
Communicating better, I suppose.


## 10/7/24
### What is one idea/topic that you have had to revisit from last year while building your project?
Using localstorage for logging in.

### What is one real world reference web site that you have used to inspire your work on this project? What is it about that site that appeals to you?
I didn't use any reference as I worked on the backend and there's really no way to see the backend of any running website.

### Have you considered how users with sight disabilities might view your site? Have you taken into account color blindness or poor vision? Do you need to re-examine or recalibrate your sites font sizes or colors?
I haven't paid too much attention to the design of our site, unfortunately. I was focused on researching login functionality, encrypting passwords, and trying to do the search function for flights.

We spoke thoroughly to each other while working on the project in class. We didn't use any tools or anything to communicate outside of class.

### How did you support your teammates, and how did they support you?
I didn't provide support for the design, but I supported Santiago on the back end for the most part.

### What are the most significant lessons you've learned from this project, both personally and professionally?
Personally: I've started to speak up a lot more often when necessary.
Professionally: I've learned more about working in a team, which is always a good experience.
